# It was a fairly easy question we just had to jump to win function to get the shell and we can cat the flag-file.
# This exploit uses the fact that gets has no control over input nad as stack-canary is not enabled so we can overflow and modify the eip 
# register and thus change the codeflow of program according to our need.
